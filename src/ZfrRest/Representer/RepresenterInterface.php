 * A representer is an object that map a resource to a specific representation. It is useful when you need to
 * version your API, so that you can specify which representer to use based on the Accept header value. A representer's
 * goal is NOT to render any data, but rather say "which data" I want. Then, an additional layer will render that
 * data according to some conventions (for instance, EmberJS library expects data to be sent a very specific way)
