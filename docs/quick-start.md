# Quick start

## Introduction

ZfrRest is a module that aims to simplify the creation of RESTful applications. It is tightly integrated to Doctrine\Common interfaces. Therefore, people already using Doctrine (ORM, ODMâ€¦) can start to write ZfrRest with nearly no code.

## Initial setup

Once you have installed the module and copied the `zfr_rest.local.php` file into your `autoloader` folder, it's start to configure it. This file contains a lot of options (nearly everything can be configured in ZfrRest!), but we are going to update the `object_manager` key. As I said earlier, ZfrRest is based on `Doctrine\Common` interfaces, where the object manager is an object that is used as a persistence layer.

If you are using DoctrineORMModule, the setup is pretty easy:

```php
return array(
	'zfr_rest' => array(
		'object_manager' => 'doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default'
	)
);
```

Users of DoctrineMongoODMModule:

```php
return array(
	'zfr_rest' => array(
		'object_manager' => 'doctrine.documentmanager.orm_default'
	)
);
```

Users that are not using Doctrine can [learn more in the cook-book](/cook-book.md) about how to use with other persistence layer like Zend\Db.

## Entity

We are going to create a very simple REST applications that interact with users. We want to be able to create, read, delete and update users. Let's first create the entity:

```php
<?php

namespace Application\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use ZfrRest\Resource\Metadata\Annotation as REST;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="Users")
 * @REST\Resource(controller="Application\Controller\UserController")
 * @REST\Collection(controller="Application\Controller\UserListController")
 */
class User
{
    /**
     * @var int
     *
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
     * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @var string
     *
     * @ORM\Column(type="string")
     */
    protected $name;

    /**
     * @param int $id
     * @return void
     */
    public function setId($id)
    {
        $this->id = $id;
    }

    /**
     * @return int
     */
    public function getId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    /**
     * @param string $name
     * @return void
     */
    public function setName($name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    /**
     * @return string
     */
    public function getName()
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
}
```

This entity contains the minimal mapping we need for ZfrRest, but we are going to add more data as soon as we progress. The ORM annotations are specific to Doctrine, so please read their documentation for more information.

Notice the @REST\Resource annotation. This mapping is specific to ZfrRest. This annotation can accept multiple attributes, but here we only use the "controller" attribute. This is to say to ZfrRest to map the user resource to a specific controller. The @REST\Collection is used in cases when the resource is a collection of objects. Indeed, in a REST model, an user and a list of users are two distinct resources. That's why we provide different mappings.

Said otherwise, typing "/users" will be dispatched to the `UserListController` (it is a collection of users) while typing "/users/4" will be dispatched to the `UserController`.

As any Zend Framework 2 controllers, we need to add them to the controllers plugin manager. In your `module.config.php` file, add the following:

```php
'controllers' => array(
    'invokables' => array(
        'Application\Controller\UserController'     => 'Application\Controller\UserController',
        'Application\Controller\UserListController' => 'Application\Controller\UserListController',
    ),
),
```

## Configurate the mapping

We are using annotations, so in order to ZfrRest to "read" the mapping, we must add a driver. Drivers in ZfrRest work pretty the same way as for Doctrine. In your `module.config.php`, add the following:

```php
return array(
	'zfr_rest' => array(
        'object_manager' => 'doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default',

        'resource_metadata' => array(
            'drivers' => array(
                'annotation_driver' => array(
                    'class' => 'ZfrRest\Resource\Metadata\Driver\AnnotationDriver'
                )
            )
        )
    ),
);
```

> In DoctrineORMModule for instance, you need to add one driver per module. In ZfrRest, the annotation driver is "global" to the whole application. However, PHP mapping is a bit more verbose as you need to set paths. More information can be found [in the PHP mapping reference](/php-mapping-reference.md).

## Writing the route

If we type "/users" in our browser, nothing happen (yet). This is because we need to create a route. The route is an entry-point to a specific resource. What is nice, however, is that associated resources are automatically discovered. For instance, if your User entity has an association with a collection of Tweet resources, you don't need to write two routes! More on that later.

In your `module.config.php` file, add the following route:

```php
return array(
	'router' => array(
        'routes' => array(
            'users' => array(
                'type'    => 'ResourceGraphRoute',
                'options' => array(
                    'route'    => '/users',
                    'resource' => 'Application\Repository\UserRepository'
                )
            )
        )
    ),
);
```

The type of the route, `ResourceGraphRoute`, is a route provided by ZfrRest. Notice the `resource` option. The object identified by the `resource` option is an object that is used to retrieve resources of a specific type. Everything in ZfrRest is retrieved using the service locator for easier dependencies handling. Therefore, we need to add a factory in the service manager to tell Zend Framework how to retrieve it:

```php
return array(
	'service_manager' => array(
        'factories' => array(
            'Application\Repository\UserRepository' => function($sl) {
                $objectManager = $sl->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default');
                return $objectManager->getRepository('Application\Entity\User');
            }
        )
    ),
);
```

If writing a factory for each repository is too tiring, you can always write an abstract factory for that.

Now, let's type "/users" in our browser.
