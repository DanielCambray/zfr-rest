## How to implement the OPTIONS method?

You have nothing to do. If you don't use any custom HTTP verbs, when an `OPTIONS` request is made to a resource,
ZfrRest automatically checks which actions are implemented on your controller, and return them in the `Allow` header
of the response.

If you are using custom HTTP verbs, you can implement yourself the `options` action in your controller, and ZfrRest
will use it instead of the built-in discovering behaviour:

```php
class MyController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    public function options()
    {
        return ['post', 'put', 'funky'];
    }
}
```

## How to customize the payload?

When returning a representation of your resource, you may want to customize heavily the payload. For instance, you
may want to not return the `password` property.

All of this is done through the use of hydrators. You can use built-in ZF2 hydrators like `Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\ClassMethods`,
but for most complex use cases, the best way is to simply create a custom hydrator, and personalize it.
